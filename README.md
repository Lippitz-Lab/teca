# Messmethoden (TECA) lecture notes as pluto notebooks

These are the lecture notes (German) of my lecture on measurement techniques, statistics, and Fourier transform. They are written as [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks, using the computer language [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The notes interweave explanatory text and examples based on real data that is processes 'live'. More details, including 'bookcast' type videos, are on the [website](https://www.ep3.uni-bayreuth.de/en/teaching/TECA/index.html).
